# OrigenLab — build and deployment status

**Purpose.** The single answer to "what is actually built, applied and
deployed right now." One page, facts only.

**Status: non-canonical.** This is the build-state index defined in
[`README.md`](README.md) → *Non-canonical build-state index*. It is not one of
the seven canonical V2 documents and cannot override them.

**This document reports:** the verified real state of every era, slice, app and
environment. **It owns no rule, decision, target, workflow, architecture or
migration policy.** What the system *should* be is owned by
[`README.md`](README.md) and the six canonical V2 documents it indexes (V2),
and by [`architecture/CURRENT_SYSTEM_TRUTH.md`](architecture/CURRENT_SYSTEM_TRUTH.md)
(V1). Where this file and a canonical document disagree about *what is built*,
the canonical document is carrying a build-state claim it should not carry and
is corrected under its own owner — not overridden here.

**Why it exists separately.** Architecture documents describe intent and drift
out of date the moment something ships — `ARCHITECTURE.md` §1 claimed "No
Supabase project, schema, role, bucket or table exists yet" for two days after
32 tables shipped and went green in CI. Status belongs in one place that is
cheap to correct, and no architecture document should restate it.

**Maintenance rule** (owned by [`README.md`](README.md), *Documentation source
of truth*). Any PR that changes what is built, applied or deployed updates this
file — including the `Last verified` line — **in the same PR**. A PR that only
changes design, rules or targets does not touch it.

Last verified: **2026-09-09**, against `origin/main` @ `e9d34e3e` plus the Slice 0 / M10b-M10d
outbound migrations on this branch, measured from a clean local `supabase db reset`.

## 1. Eras

| Era | State |
|---|---|
| **V1** | **Running and authoritative** for every fact it owns today, including all outbound safety |
| **V2** | Architecture **accepted 2026-09-05**. **Local schema foundation only.** No hosted project, no application code, nothing deployed |

## 2. V2 — slice status

Slices and their gates are defined in [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md) §5.

| Slice | State | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — local foundation | **DONE** | `supabase/roles.sql` + 18 migrations → 4 roles, 7 schemas, 33 tables, grants, RLS. Proven by `supabase/tests/` and `supabase/scripts/`, enforced by `.github/workflows/supabase.yml` on every push touching `supabase/**` |
| 0 — hosted gates | **NOT STARTED** | **No hosted Supabase project, bucket, backup or advisor run exists.** All 11 checks in [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md) §5.2 are unproven against a hosted project; checks 1–9 are proven **locally only**, checks 10–11 have never run |
| 1 — Auth / `platform.*` | NOT STARTED | |
| 2 — CRM identity + V1 row migration | NOT STARTED | |
| 3 — Quotes, lines, FX, snapshot, PDF | NOT STARTED | |
| 4 — Evidence, comms, shadow Gmail, catalog, notices | NOT STARTED | |
| 5 — Wave 1A load, send functions, reconciler | NOT STARTED | |
| 6 — Sender handoff | NOT STARTED | |
| 7 — Rollback window | NOT STARTED | |
| 8 — Decommission V1 | NOT STARTED | |

### 2.1 V2 local foundation — measured

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Migrations | 18, under `supabase/migrations/` |
| Schemas | 7 — `crm`, `comms`, `outbound`, `evidence`, `catalog`, `procurement`, `platform` |
| Tables | **33** — `crm` 16, `comms` 4, `outbound` 6, `evidence` 2, `catalog` 2, `procurement` 1, `platform` 2 |
| Roles | 4 — `origenlab_owner` (NOLOGIN), `origenlab_migrator`, `origenlab_api`, `origenlab_worker`; all `NOBYPASSRLS` |
| RLS policies | 127 |
| pgTAP assertions | 372 across 10 files |
| Foreign keys | 102, **all** index-covered — 81 unconditional, 21 implied-partial |
| `SECURITY DEFINER` functions | **zero** — the closed list of eight arrives in slices 3 and 5 |
| Data API (PostgREST) | **off**; the seven schemas are not exposed |
| Send flags | `outbound.send_control` single row, **both `false`** |
| Rows of business data | **zero** |

### 2.2 What does not exist yet in V2

- **`apps/worker`** — named in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §1–§2 as the owner of
  Gmail sync, MIME parsing, PDF rendering, ChileCompra fetching and the single
  send path. Not created.
- **Any application code touching the seven schemas.** Slice 0 has **zero
  consumers**; nothing in `apps/` references it.
- **The eight privileged send/quote functions** of [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §6.2.
- **The Wave 1A loader.** The bundle itself exists on disk with its `.sha256`
  sidecar; no code loads it.
- **The `ol migrate` / `ol audit` CLI** documented in [`OPERATIONS.md`](OPERATIONS.md) §4
  — marked there as `EXAMPLE — NOT YET IMPLEMENTED`, and it is not implemented.
- **Any tool that can target a hosted project.** `supabase/scripts/lib/local_target.sh`
  refuses a non-loopback host by design, so the hosted gate is currently
  unreachable with the tooling in this repository.

## 3. V1 — running state

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Apps | `apps/api` (FastAPI :8001), `apps/dashboard`, `apps/dashboard-proxy`, `apps/email-pipeline`, `apps/web` |
| Alembic migrations | 46, head **`20260902_0046`** |
| Durable CRM | PostgreSQL `commercial.*` |
| Archive | `~/data/origenlab-email/sqlite/emails.sqlite`, **~66 GB**, ~221,752 messages |
| Outbound authority | **V1 SQLite only** — campaign, recipients, send attempts, suppression. There is no Postgres mirror of the campaign ledger |
| Sender | Gmail API only, no SMTP. `origenlab outbound-campaign send` is **dry-run by default**; `--live` additionally requires an OAuth client and token file |

### 3.1 Deployment

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| Render | `origenlab-api` (Docker, 1 GB disk), `origenlab-dashboard` (static), managed Postgres. **No Render cron jobs.** |
| Cloudflare | `apps/dashboard-proxy` Worker at `dashboard.origenlab.cl/api*` |
| Operator machine | `auto-refresh-mail` every 3 min; `auto-mirror-dashboard` every 1 min; systemd user units for the local API |
| GitHub Actions | 7 workflows; **none is scheduled** — all are push/PR path-filtered |

### 3.2 Known operational facts that surprise people

- **The production runtime checkout is 125 commits behind `origin/main`.**
  `/home/rafael/dev/freelance/origenlab` is at `66623060`. That is the tree the
  cron jobs execute.
- **The SQLite→Postgres dashboard mirror is not running, and that is safe.** It
  fail-closes on an Alembic head mismatch: the production tree expects
  `20260901_0042`, the database is at `20260902_0046`. `apps/api` reads the
  durable tables directly, so nothing an operator depends on flows through it.
  [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md) §2 decides it **stays paused** and is never
  repaired merely to serve the migration.
- **The Postgres `outbound.*` sidecar mirror is stale.** `/mirror/outbound`
  reads it live and correctly, but its only writer is a parked break-glass
  script. Do not treat its contents as current.
- **V1 has no consent model and no unsubscribe mechanism.** No
  `List-Unsubscribe` header is generated and no unsubscribe endpoint exists.
  `manual_contact_status.active` is explicitly *not* consent — the code says so
  in two places. V2 designs an unsubscribe path
  ([`WORKFLOWS.md`](WORKFLOWS.md) §W10, still `[OPEN]`); it is not built.
- **`apps/email-pipeline/scripts/validate.sh` runs a narrow subset**, not the
  full pytest suite. Use `scripts/check-all.sh` for anything touching pipeline
  logic.

### 3.3 Open — needs an operator check, not a code change

- **Are `ORIGENLAB_COMMERCIAL_OPERATIONS_WRITES_ENABLED` and
  `ORIGENLAB_POSTGRES_WRITE_URL` set on the deployed Render service?** Neither
  appears in `render.yaml`, and `commercial_operations_writes_enabled` defaults
  to `False` in `apps/api/src/origenlab_api/settings.py`. If they were not set
  by hand in the Render dashboard, **every `POST /operations/*` durable write is
  returning 503 in production** and the Cotizaciones and Pipeline boards cannot
  write. Record the answer here once checked.

## 4. Cross-era hazards

- **Schema names collide.** `evidence.*`, `outbound.*` and `catalog.*` exist in
  **both** the V1 Alembic Postgres and the V2 Supabase Postgres, with entirely
  **disjoint** table sets. A `grep` for `outbound.` returns both systems. See
  [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md) §2.
- **Two independent migration systems.** V1 is Alembic under
  `apps/email-pipeline/alembic/versions/`; V2 is the Supabase CLI under
  `supabase/migrations/`. They do not communicate.
